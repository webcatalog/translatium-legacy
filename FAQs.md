##### Why speech recognition and some other features are removed?
On November 7th, 2018, Translatium was removed from sale because the unofficial Google Translate [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) the app relied on were partially blocked by Google. In August 2019, we managed to bring the app back to life using legitimate APIs from other providers. While this decision allows the app to continue operating, it also forces us to remove certain features from the app. Still, we will try to add these features back in the future if possible.
